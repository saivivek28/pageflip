  "Dammmnn this book!! Really if you're having prblm in your friendship then definitely read this book. This book have given me the solution to my never ending thoughts. Definitely one of the best book it felt oddly relatable to meü•∫. Well end wasn't expected i wanted it to extend a little more like as they had mentioned about reunion party so I wanted it to be covered and then to sort things out but nothing like tht happened. But somewhere in a way it is good too. It gives a reality check and reality vibe tht not always there is a happy ending life isn't like tht we need to live with the sorrows and scars of the past still diving into future. HahhüòÆ‚Äçüí®. Well reading this book was worth it. 1stly I felt it boring but thanks to me and my patience that I stick to it. I wonder if this is the real story of author or someone.. well wish u luck if you're going to read it definitely worth it. Good day ‚ú®"

      "description": "\"One Day in December\" by Josie Silver is a novel that follows Laurie, who experiences love at first sight with a man she sees through a bus window on a snowy December day. Over the next year, she searches for him, only to discover he's her best friend Sarah's new boyfriend, Jack. The story then spans a decade, exploring their complex relationships, missed opportunities, and the enduring nature of friendship.",
"reviews": [
  "I think this book is a little underrated.",
  "This book has a totally Christmassy feeling. The story is basically Laurie met a guy on the way home before Christmas, she took a bus, and she was complaining about how unreasonable public transport is. But life is not that bad so she kind of gets a filmy moment when she sees a guy perched on the fold-down seats in the bus shelter with a book, like the world has been stopped around him and felt like love at first sight. They had eye contact and then the bus started going again. She is searching for that guy, she doesn't know his name or where he lives or anything.",
  "She has a best friend, Sarah, she is her flatmate also and you know how best friends work they support you every time you are being unreasonable. Sarah is smart, and beautiful and loves Laurie so much they are kind of sisters from another mother. Sarah found a guy and fell in love with him, she thinks he is the one and she wants Laurie to meet him because she needs her best friend's opinion, that guy is the guy Laurie is searching for ages, but she can't say anything because her best friend finally found a guy. So finally she met Jake, he is everything she expected. What she did after that was the story.",
  "This story is like you are watching a film on Christmas. You'll surely enjoy it. There are a few parts that were toxic, when Laurie got married to a guy she met on vacation. Marriage wasn't toxic but when you get married to someone but there is a part of you that knows you are still in love with someone else, that is toxic but that makes this story more dramatic though. I'm not telling you that you need to be toxic when you are in love don't get me wrong, I'm talking about the story only.",
  "To be very honest the last part was kind of overdramatic that I love. When you are in so much love you can be a little filmy and overdramatic. The feeling of finally confessing to the person you are in love with that he loves you back is not a joke. Overall this is a very dramatic cute love story.",
  "I read this in 2021 and still remember most of the part."
